# n-queens
One Ruby solution to the classic programming problem of n queens, that is, find every way to arrange n queens on an n x n sized chessboard such that none of the queens are attacking each other along a file, rank, or diagonal. This solution prints each arrangement that satisfies these conditions (where 0 = the top-left corner, 1 = the square to the right of this, etc.) and also gives a count of the total number of arrangements.

This was a fun one! I recommend you go and try to solve it right now.
